## Architecture Evaluations

### Real-Time Streaming Architecture

> Source: `docs/evaluations/realtime-streaming-architecture-evaluation.md`
> Date: 2026-02-03 | Status: Evaluation Complete

**Verdict:** Fundamentally sound with good resilience patterns.

**Strengths:**
- 5 streaming providers behind `IMarketDataClient` abstraction (Alpaca, Polygon, IB, StockSharp, NYSE)
- `EventPipeline` uses `System.Threading.Channels` with bounded capacity (100,000 events) and configurable backpressure
- Polly-based retry and circuit breaker policies for WebSocket connections
- Domain collectors (`TradeDataCollector`, `MarketDepthCollector`, `QuoteCollector`) separate parsing from routing
- `SubscriptionManager` tracks active subscriptions for recovery on reconnect

**Improvement Opportunities:**
| Priority | Opportunity | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | Optimize EventPipeline throughput for >100 Hz scenarios | Partially addressed (C4 injectable metrics done) |
| P1 | Enhance backpressure signaling to prevent data loss under load | `DroppedEventAuditTrail` implemented (B1 done) |
| P2 | Unify WebSocket lifecycle across providers via base class | Open (C3 in IMPROVEMENTS.md) |
| P2 | Provider degradation scoring for intelligent failover | Done (H4) |

---

### Storage Architecture

> Source: `docs/evaluations/storage-architecture-evaluation.md`
> Date: 2026-02-03 | Status: Evaluation Complete

**Verdict:** Well-designed for archival-first market data collection.

**Strengths:**
- Dual-format: JSONL (human-readable, append-only) + Parquet (columnar, compressed)
- Write-Ahead Log (WAL) with SHA256 checksums for crash-safe persistence
- 4 naming conventions (BySymbol, ByDate, ByType, Flat) for flexible organization
- 3 compression profiles: RealTime (LZ4), Standard (Gzip), Archive (ZSTD-19)
- Tiered storage (Hot/Warm/Cold) with configurable retention and automatic migration

**Improvement Opportunities:**
| Priority | Opportunity | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | CompositeSink for multi-format writes with fault isolation | Done (C6) |
| P2 | Optimize Parquet write batching for reduced memory pressure | Open |
| P2 | Add storage space forecasting and quota warnings | QuotaEnforcementService exists |
| P3 | Crystallized storage format for ultra-compressed long-term archival | Documented in `docs/architecture/` |

---

### Data Quality Monitoring

> Source: `docs/evaluations/data-quality-monitoring-evaluation.md`
> Date: 2026-02-03 | Status: Evaluation Complete

**Verdict:** Comprehensive and well-designed; 12+ specialized services.

**Service Inventory:**

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `DataQualityMonitoringService` | Orchestrates all quality checks |
| `CompletenessScoreCalculator` | Data completeness percentage |
| `GapAnalyzer` | Missing data period detection |
| `SequenceErrorTracker` | Out-of-order / duplicate events |
| `AnomalyDetector` | Price spike / crossed market detection |
| `LatencyHistogram` | End-to-end latency distribution |
| `CrossProviderComparisonService` | Data consistency across providers |
| `PriceContinuityChecker` | Price gap and continuity validation |
| `DataFreshnessSlaMonitor` | SLA compliance for data freshness |
| `DataQualityReportGenerator` | Daily quality reports |

|----------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | Automated gap remediation (trigger backfill on detected gaps) | Open |
| P2 | ML-based anomaly detection (move beyond threshold-based rules) | Open |
| P2 | Quality scoring per provider for intelligent routing | Partial (degradation scoring done via H4) |
| P3 | Historical quality trend visualization | Open |

---

### Historical Data Providers

> Source: `docs/evaluations/historical-data-providers-evaluation.md`
> Date: 2026-02-20 | Status: Updated

**Verdict:** Multi-provider architecture is well-designed.

**Provider Recommendations:**

| Tier | Provider | Best For | Free Tier |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Primary | Alpaca | US equities, intraday bars | Yes (with account) |
| Primary | Polygon | Professional tick data, aggregates | Limited |
| Secondary | Interactive Brokers | Comprehensive coverage, all types | Yes (with account) |
| Fallback | Tiingo | Cost-effective daily bars | Yes |
| Fallback | Stooq | International coverage, daily bars | Yes |
| Fallback | Yahoo Finance | Free daily bars (unofficial API) | Yes |
| Supplementary | Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, Nasdaq Data Link | Specialized use cases | Limited/Yes |

**Key Architecture Features:**
- `CompositeHistoricalDataProvider` with priority-based fallback chain
- `ProviderRateLimitTracker` enforces per-provider rate limits (H1 done)
- Health monitoring and automatic provider deprioritization
- Symbol resolution across providers

**Improvement Opportunities:**
| Priority | Opportunity | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | Validate Polygon rate-limit assumptions against current docs | Open |
| P2 | Add tick-level historical data from IB for verification | Requires IBAPI build flag |
| P3 | Provider SDK auto-documentation from attributes | Open (I4 in ROADMAP) |

---

### Ingestion Orchestration

> Source: `docs/evaluations/ingestion-orchestration-evaluation.md`
> Date: 2026-02-12 | Status: Evaluation Complete

**Verdict:** Strong building blocks; orchestration maturity is uneven.

**Strengths:**
- Clean provider and storage abstractions enable scheduler-independent execution
- WAL + tiered storage reduces data-loss risk for long-running jobs
- Existing health and quality monitoring can be reused for orchestration signals
- Desktop UI already exposes backfill and status concepts

**Gap Analysis:**

| Gap | Risk | Priority |
|-----|------|----------|
| No unified job contract across realtime/backfill flows | Inconsistent behaviors | P0 — **Resolved**: `IngestionJobService` manages unified `IngestionJob` lifecycle with state machine; API endpoints at `/api/ingestion/jobs` |
| Limited checkpoint semantics exposed to users | Manual reruns after partial failures | P0 — **Resolved**: `IngestionJobService.UpdateCheckpointAsync()` + `/api/ingestion/jobs/resumable` endpoint exposes checkpoint semantics |
| Retry policy lacks workload-level intent | Over-retry, provider throttling | P1 |
| Missing explicit idempotency strategy | Duplicate records or unnecessary rewrites | P1 |
| Weak operator timeline/audit view | Harder post-incident analysis | P1 |

**Target Capabilities:**
1. **Unified Ingestion Job State Machine** — `Draft → Queued → Running → Paused → Completed | Failed | Cancelled`
2. **Policy-Driven Scheduler** — Cron, session-aware, signal-triggered
3. **Deterministic Resumability** — Resume from last committed checkpoint
4. **Idempotent Writes** — Dedupe keys: `(provider, symbol, timestamp, event_type, sequence)`

---

### Operational Readiness

> Source: `docs/evaluations/operational-readiness-evaluation.md`
> Date: 2026-02-12 | Status: Evaluation Complete

**Verdict:** Development / Pilot Ready. Good monitoring baseline; needs operational hardening.

**Strengths:**
- Docker and systemd deployment artifacts present
- Extensive GitHub Actions workflows (22 workflows)
- Prometheus metrics and alert rule definitions available
- Active documentation for status, roadmap, and architecture

**Risk Matrix:**

| Risk | Impact | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| SLOs not consistently documented per subsystem | Hard to calibrate alerts | P0 — **Resolved**: `SloDefinitionRegistry` provides 7 runtime SLO definitions across 6 subsystems, each linked to alert rules and runbook sections. Full docs in `service-level-objectives.md` |
| Alert-to-runbook linkage is implicit | Slower incident triage | P0 — **Resolved**: `AlertRunbookRegistry` maps all 11 Prometheus alerts to runbook sections with probable causes, immediate actions, and SLO references. `EnrichWithRunbook()` augments dispatched alerts |
| Release readiness criteria are dispersed | Regressions reaching production | P1 |
| Rollback playbooks not standardized | Longer MTTR | P1 |
| Capacity thresholds under-specified | Late scaling detection | P2 |

**60-Day Plan:**
1. Weeks 1-2: Document SLOs for ingestion, storage, and export paths
2. Weeks 3-4: Embed runbook URLs into critical alert annotations
3. Weeks 5-6: Introduce consolidated release gate checklist in CI
4. Weeks 7-8: Review alert precision/recall; publish reliability scorecard

## Desktop Assessments

### Desktop UX Assessment

> Source: `docs/evaluations/desktop-end-user-improvements.md`
> Date: 2026-02-21 | Status: Partial Implementation In Progress

**Scope:** 49 XAML pages, 104 services (72 shared + 32 WPF-specific), 1,266 tests

**Implemented Features:**

| Feature | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Command Palette (Ctrl+K) | Done | 47 commands, fuzzy search, recent tracking |
| Onboarding Tours | Done | 5 built-in tours with progress persistence |
| Workspace Persistence | Done | 4 default workspaces, session state, window bounds |
| Backfill Checkpoints | Done | Per-symbol progress, resume/retry, disk persistence |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Done | 35 shortcuts with full service and tests |
| Fixture Mode | Done | Explicit `--fixture` / `MDC_FIXTURE_MODE` activation with visual warning |

**Remaining Priorities:**

| Priority | Gap | Impact |
|----------|-----|--------|
| P0 | Replace demo/simulated values with live backend state | Users can trust what they see — **Resolved**: `StatusServiceBase` now populates `DataProvenance` field ("live"/"fixture"/"offline") on `SimpleStatus`; `FixtureModeDetector` integration drives the banner |
| P0 | Resumable jobs with crash recovery for backfill/exports | Long-running work not lost — **Resolved**: `IngestionJobService` with checkpoint persistence + `/api/ingestion/jobs/resumable` endpoint |
| P0 | Explicit staleness + source provenance on key metrics | Prevents decisions on stale data — **Resolved**: `SimpleStatus` now includes `RetrievedAtUtc`, `SourceProvider`, `IsStale`, `AgeSeconds`, `DataProvenance` fields |
| P1 | Actionable error diagnostics with root-cause hints | Faster debugging for data engineers |
| P1 | Bulk symbol management (import/validate/fix workflows) | Faster portfolio setup |
| P2 | Alert intelligence (suppress duplicates, smart recommendations) | Reduced alert fatigue |

---

### Desktop Provider Configurability

> Source: `docs/evaluations/windows-desktop-provider-configurability-assessment.md`
> Date: 2026-02-13 | Status: Proposed

**Key Finding:** Provider abstraction is solid (`IHistoricalDataProvider`, `CompositeHistoricalDataProvider`), but WPF Backfill page is mostly demo/static and lacks per-provider operational settings UI.

**Changes Introduced:**
- New shared DTOs: `BackfillConfigDto.Providers`, `BackfillProvidersConfigDto`, `BackfillProviderOptionsDto`
- Typed contract for per-provider options: Enabled, Priority, RateLimitPerMinute
- Desktop backfill provider config service for UI editing

---

### Desktop Improvement Shortlist

> Source: `docs/evaluations/desktop-end-user-improvements-shortlist.md`

**Target Personas:** Active Trader, Quant Researcher, Data Engineer, Portfolio Analyst, New User

**P0 — Critical Trust and Continuity (All Resolved):**
- ~~Replace demo/simulated values with live backend state~~ — **Done**: `StatusServiceBase` sets `DataProvenance`
- ~~Add resumable jobs with crash recovery~~ — **Done**: `IngestionJobService` with disk-persisted checkpoints
- ~~Show explicit staleness + source provenance~~ — **Done**: `SimpleStatus` provenance fields
- ~~Hard visual distinction for sample/offline mode~~ — **Done**: `MainPage.xaml` fixture mode banner with dynamic color/label

**P1 — Productivity and Incident Response:**
- Actionable error diagnostics with guided remediation
- Bulk symbol import with validation previews
- Provider health badges on data-consuming pages

**P2 — Intelligence and Polish:**
- Alert intelligence (suppress duplicates, recommend actions)
- Data quality explainability (root-cause hints)
- Export workflow hardening (format validation, progress)

## Code Audits

### Repository Hygiene (H1-H3)

> Source: `docs/audits/CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
> Date: 2026-02-10 | Status: Complete

| Item | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| H1 | Accidental artifact file tracked in repo | Removed; `.gitignore` patterns added |
| H2 | `build-output.log` (93,549 bytes) in version control | Removed; `*.log` pattern prevents recurrence |
| H3 | Root-level narrative docs diluting discoverability | Moved to `docs/archived/` with date prefixes |

**Outcome:** Repository root is clean. All hygiene items resolved.

---

### Debug Code Analysis (H3)

> Source: `docs/audits/H3_DEBUG_CODE_ANALYSIS.md`
> Date: 2026-02-10 | Status: Complete

| Category | Instances | Verdict |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `Console.WriteLine` | 20 | All intentional (CLI output, user-facing diagnostics) |
| `Debug.WriteLine` | 20 | All properly conditional (`#if DEBUG` or diagnostic context) |
| Skipped Tests | Reviewed | All have documented rationale |

**Conclusion:** Excellent code quality. No cleanup required.

---

### Platform Cleanup (UWP Removal)

> Source: `docs/audits/CLEANUP_OPPORTUNITIES.md`
> Date: 2026-02-10 (updated 2026-02-20) | Status: Complete

**Summary of Completed Work:**

| UWP Service Migration (WPF is sole desktop client) | Done |
| Residual UWP References (R1-R9, all 9 items cleaned) | Done |
| HtmlTemplates Split (3 partial class files, 2,533 LOC) | Done |
| Storage Services Split (PortableDataPackager: 5 files, AnalysisExportService: 6 files) | Done |
| Architecture Debt (DataGapRepair DI, SubscriptionManager rename) | Done |

**Remaining:**
- Generated docs not yet refreshed to reflect post-UWP state
- HtmlTemplateGenerator still embeds CSS/JS inline (2,533 LOC) — could move to `wwwroot/`

3. Phase 3 (Service Deduplication): Done
4. Phase 4 (Large File Decomposition): Done
5. Phase 5 (Documentation Consolidation): Done
6. Phase 6 (Build and CI Optimization): Done

---

### Config Consolidation

> Source: `CONFIG_CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md` (root)
> Date: 2026-02-10 | Status: Complete

**Findings:**
- Props/targets files: No duplicates (3 files, each distinct purpose)
- Global config: Removed duplicate diagnostic suppressions
- Application config: No duplication found

---

## Cross-Cutting Findings

These themes recur across multiple evaluations:

### 1. Provider Registration Unification (Theme C)

Multiple evaluations (streaming, historical, desktop configurability) identify fragmented provider registration as a friction point. Currently 3 separate creation mechanisms exist.

**Tracked as:** C1 (Unified Provider Registry), C2 (Single DI Composition Path) in IMPROVEMENTS.md — both Open.

### 2. Operational SLO Standardization

Both the operational readiness and data quality evaluations recommend formal SLO definitions per subsystem to improve alert quality and incident response.

**Tracked as:** Part of Phase 9 (Final Production Release) in ROADMAP.md.

### 3. Unified Job/Orchestration Model

The ingestion orchestration and desktop UX evaluations both highlight the need for a unified job state machine covering both realtime and historical workloads.

**Tracked as:** H3 (Event Replay Infrastructure) and Objective 5 (Scalability) in ROADMAP.md.

### 4. Code Simplification Backlog

The further simplification audit identified ~2,800-3,400 lines of removable code. High-priority items (`Task.Run` misuse, bare catches, dead code) should be addressed before the next release.

**Tracked as:** Not yet in IMPROVEMENTS.md themes — recommended for inclusion in Phase 8 (Repository Organization).

# Claude Code Skills

This directory is the navigation index for **Claude Code skill definitions** used in the Market Data
Collector project. Skills live in `.claude/skills/` so that Claude Code can discover and load them
automatically.

Step-by-step guided skill for building new data provider adapters for MarketDataCollector.
Covers all three provider types (`IMarketDataClient`, `IHistoricalDataProvider`,
`ISymbolSearchProvider`) with a 12-step build process, compliance checklist, and known AI
error table.

**Trigger conditions:**

- User asks to add a new data provider, exchange, or data source
- Tasks involving `IMarketDataClient`, `IHistoricalDataProvider`, `DataSourceAttribute`, or `ProviderSdk`
- Implementing rate limiting, WebSocket reconnection, or DI registration for a provider

**Copilot equivalent:** [`.github/agents/mdc-test-writer-agent.md`](../../../.github/agents/mdc-test-writer-agent.md)

Test generation skill for any MarketDataCollector component. Produces idiomatic xUnit +
FluentAssertions tests with correct async patterns, isolation, naming conventions, and mock
setup for all major component types.

**Trigger conditions:**

- User asks to write, add, or expand tests for any MDC component
- Code review (mdc-code-review Lens 4) identified test quality issues or gaps
- New provider, service, or storage component needs a test scaffold

### ai-docs-maintain

**Registered in:** [`.claude/skills/skills_provider.py`](../../../.claude/skills/skills_provider.py)
_(code-defined only — no separate directory)_

AI documentation maintenance skill. Delegates to `build/scripts/docs/ai-docs-maintenance.py`.

**Trigger conditions:**

- User asks to check AI doc freshness, detect drift, archive stale docs, or validate cross-references
- Tasks involving "update AI docs", "check doc staleness", or "sync AI instructions"

**Available scripts:**

| Script | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `run-freshness` | Check staleness of all AI docs (60-day warning, 120-day critical) |
| `run-drift` | Detect divergence between docs and code reality |
| `run-full` | Run all checks (freshness + drift + refs + archive) |
| `run-archive` | Preview (or execute) stale doc archiving |

**Available resource:**

- `doc-health-summary` — Live health summary (stale count, drift items, broken refs)

---

## Skills Provider

The skills provider [`skills_provider.py`](../../../.claude/skills/skills_provider.py) handles:

- File-based skill discovery from `.claude/skills/mdc-code-review/`
- Code-defined skill registration (`mdc-code-review` fallback, `ai-docs-maintain`)
- Dynamic resource evaluation (live project stats, git context)
- In-process script execution (validate-skill, run-eval, aggregate-benchmark)
- File-based script subprocess execution

---

## Architecture Guard Tool

The `mdc-architecture-guard` tool is a standalone Python compliance checker at
[`build/scripts/ai-architecture-check.py`](../../../build/scripts/ai-architecture-check.py).
It is not a skill invoked via the Claude skill system — it is a command-line tool that AI agents
run before submitting a PR to catch architecture violations.

**What it checks:**

| Check ID | Rule |
| -------- | ---- |
| `CPM-001` | No `Version=` on `<PackageReference>` items (NU1008 guard) |
| `DEP-001` – `DEP-006` | Forbidden dependency directions (Ui.Services→Wpf, ProviderSdk→Infrastructure, UWP refs, FSharp→non-Contracts) |
| `ADR-001` / `ADR-005` | Missing `[ImplementsAdr]` and `[DataSource]` on provider classes |
| `CHAN-001` | Raw `Channel.CreateBounded/CreateUnbounded` calls (must use `EventPipelinePolicy`) |
| `SINK-001` | Direct `FileStream` / `File.Write*` in storage sinks (must use `AtomicFileWriter`) |
| `JSON-001` | Reflection-based `JsonSerializer` calls without source-gen context |
| `LOG-001` | String interpolation (`$"..."`) in structured log calls |

**Usage:**

```bash
# Full check (human-readable)
make ai-arch-check

# One-line summary (useful in pre-PR scripts)
make ai-arch-check-summary

# JSON output (for CI or tooling)
make ai-arch-check-json

# Targeted checks
python3 build/scripts/ai-architecture-check.py --src src/ check-cpm
python3 build/scripts/ai-architecture-check.py --src src/ check-adrs
python3 build/scripts/ai-architecture-check.py --src src/ check-channels
```

## Running Skill Evaluations

```bash
# Validate skill definition
python3 .claude/skills/mdc-code-review/scripts/quick_validate.py

# Run eval set (8 test cases)
python3 .claude/skills/mdc-code-review/scripts/run_eval.py \
  --eval-set .claude/skills/mdc-code-review/evals/evals.json \
  --skill-path .claude/skills/mdc-code-review

# Launch interactive eval viewer
python3 .claude/skills/mdc-code-review/eval-viewer/generate_review.py
```

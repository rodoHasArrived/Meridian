# Operational Readiness Evaluation

## Market Data Collector — Deployment, Observability, and Incident Response Assessment

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Evaluation Complete — Recommendations Substantially Adopted
**Author:** Architecture Review

---

## Executive Summary

This evaluation reviews operational readiness across deployment consistency, runtime observability, alert quality, incident workflows, and maintenance hygiene.

**Key Finding:** The project has meaningful operational assets (monitoring configs, multiple workflow automations, and status documentation), but production readiness would improve significantly with standardized service-level objectives (SLOs), runbook-linked alerts, and stricter release gates.

---

## A. Scope

The assessment covered:

1. Deployment paths (Docker/systemd/desktop packaging).
2. Metrics, logs, and traces alignment.
3. Alert signal quality and escalation paths.
4. Runbook completeness and operator handoff.
5. Release confidence controls (quality gates, rollback posture).

## B. Current-State Evaluation

### Strengths

| Domain | Current Strength | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Deployment flexibility | Docker and systemd deployment artifacts are present | Supports multiple operator environments |
| CI workflow coverage | Extensive GitHub Actions workflows exist for build/test/security tasks | Good base for release governance |
| Monitoring baseline | Prometheus and alert rule definitions are available | Enables measurable reliability controls |
| Documentation depth | Status, roadmap, and architecture documentation are actively maintained | Improves team alignment and onboarding |

### Risks

| Risk | Operational Impact | Priority |
|------|--------------------|----------|
| SLOs not consistently documented per subsystem | Hard to calibrate alerts and incident severity | P0 |
| Alert-to-runbook linkage is implicit | Slower incident triage and inconsistent response | P0 |
| Release readiness criteria are dispersed | Increased chance of regressions reaching production | P1 |
| Rollback playbooks are not clearly standardized | Longer MTTR during failed deployments | P1 |
| Capacity thresholds are under-specified | Late detection of scaling bottlenecks | P2 |

## C. Target Operating Model

### 1) SLO-Centered Reliability Framework

Define SLOs for key planes:
- **Ingestion freshness** (e.g., P95 end-to-end latency).
- **Data completeness** (daily expected vs received events).
- **Availability** (collector uptime and API health).

Each SLO should include:
- Error budget policy.
- Burn-rate thresholds.
- Incident priority mapping.

### 2) Alerting with Embedded Actionability

Every high-severity alert should include:
- Symptom summary and probable causes.
- Link to the exact runbook section.
- Immediate mitigations and rollback criteria.

### 3) Release Gate Consolidation

Create a single release checklist including:
- Required tests/workflows.
- Data quality smoke checks.
- Deployment verification and rollback simulation.

### 4) Incident Lifecycle Standardization

Standardize four phases:
- Detect → Triage → Mitigate → Learn.

Post-incident template should capture:
- Timeline, user impact, root cause, corrective actions, and follow-up owner.

## D. 60-Day Improvement Plan

### Weeks 1–2
- Document SLOs for ingestion, storage, and export paths.
- Map current alerts to SLOs and identify noisy/unowned alerts.

### Weeks 3–4
- Embed runbook URLs and mitigation hints into critical alert annotations.
- Add incident severity matrix and escalation flow into operations docs.

### Weeks 5–6
- Introduce consolidated release gate checklist in CI.
- Add rollback drill verification to pre-release validation.

### Weeks 7–8
- Review alert precision/recall after tuning.
- Publish monthly reliability scorecard (SLO, MTTR, repeat incidents).

---

## E. Readiness KPIs

- **Alert actionability rate:** % alerts resolved using linked runbooks.
- **MTTA/MTTR:** mean time to acknowledge and recover.
- **Change failure rate:** % releases requiring rollback/hotfix.
- **SLO attainment:** % windows meeting each defined target.
- **Repeat incident rate:** recurrence of same root cause within 30 days.

---

## Recommendation

Adopt SLO-first operations and release-gate consolidation as the next reliability milestone. This creates a shared contract between engineering and operations, reduces noisy incidents, and increases confidence as data throughput and feature complexity grow.

## F. Implementation Follow-Up (2026-02-25)

Many of the P0 and P1 recommendations from this evaluation have been adopted:

| Recommendation | Status | Implementation |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Document SLOs per subsystem | ✅ Done | [Service-Level Objectives](../operations/service-level-objectives.md) — covers ingestion freshness, data completeness, and API availability |
| Monitoring baseline with Prometheus | ✅ Done | `PrometheusMetrics`, `DataFreshnessSlaMonitor`, `DataQualityMonitoringService` |
| Operator runbook | ✅ Done | [Operator Runbook](../operations/operator-runbook.md) — comprehensive incident procedures |
| Health probes for Kubernetes | ✅ Done | `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez` endpoints with detailed health checks |
| Data quality enforcement | ✅ Done | `CompletenessScoreCalculator`, `GapAnalyzer`, `AnomalyDetector`, `SequenceErrorTracker` |
| Alert-to-runbook linkage | ⚠️ Partial | Alert rule definitions exist in `deploy/monitoring/alert-rules.yml`; explicit runbook URLs in annotations are not yet embedded |
| Consolidated release gate | ⚠️ Partial | PR checks and test matrix workflows exist; a single pre-release checklist is not yet formalized |
| Rollback playbooks | 📝 Open | Standardized rollback procedures not yet documented |

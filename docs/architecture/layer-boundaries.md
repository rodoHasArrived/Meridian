# Layer Boundary Rules

This document defines the allowed dependency directions between layer assemblies.
These boundaries are enforced by **project references** (compile-time) and
**Roslyn analyzer rules** (IDE warnings).

## Forbidden Dependencies

| From Assembly        | Must NOT Reference          | Reason                                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Domain**          | Application, Infrastructure, Storage, Core | Pure business logic, no external deps |
| **Core**            | Application, Infrastructure, Storage       | Shared utilities only                 |
| **Infrastructure**  | Application, Storage                       | No upward deps, no peer deps         |
| **Storage**         | Application, Infrastructure                | No upward deps, no peer deps         |
| **Application**     | (none forbidden)                           | Top-level orchestrator                |
| **Ui.Services**     | Wpf host types                             | Must stay platform-neutral            |
| **Ui.Shared**       | WPF-only APIs, Ui.Services                 | Must stay web-host-agnostic           |
| **Ui / Wpf hosts**  | Each other                                 | No host-to-host references            |
| **Contracts**       | UI or application hosts                    | Pure contract layer                   |

## Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Project References**: Each `.csproj` only lists allowed `<ProjectReference>` entries.
   MSBuild will fail if a type from an unreferenced assembly is used.

2. **Roslyn Analyzer Rules**: `Directory.Build.targets` injects per-project
   `RS0037` (Banned Symbols) rules that flag `using` statements importing
   forbidden namespaces.

3. **CI Gate**: The `pr-checks.yml` workflow runs `dotnet build` which catches
   any project reference violations at compile time.

## Examples

### Allowed: Application using Infrastructure

```csharp
// In MarketDataCollector.Application/Services/SomeService.cs
using MarketDataCollector.Infrastructure.Providers; // ✅ OK — Application may reference Infrastructure
```

### Forbidden: Infrastructure using Application

```csharp
// In MarketDataCollector.Infrastructure/Adapters/SomeProvider.cs
using MarketDataCollector.Application.Services; // ❌ COMPILE ERROR — Infrastructure cannot reference Application
```

The compiler enforces this because `MarketDataCollector.Infrastructure.csproj` does not have a `<ProjectReference>` to `MarketDataCollector.Application`.

### Forbidden: Domain using Core

```csharp
// In MarketDataCollector.Domain/Collectors/TradeDataCollector.cs
using MarketDataCollector.Core.Logging; // ❌ FORBIDDEN — Domain must remain pure business logic
```

Domain uses only `Contracts` and `ProviderSdk`. If Domain needs a utility from Core, the utility should be moved to Contracts or an interface defined in ProviderSdk.

### Common Pattern: Extracting Shared Types

When Infrastructure and Storage both need the same type, define it in Contracts or Core:

```
❌ Bad: Infrastructure.Providers.SomeSharedModel → Storage cannot see it
✅ Good: Contracts.Domain.Models.SomeSharedModel → Both can reference it
```

## Adding a New Layer Dependency

If a new cross-layer dependency is needed:

1. Check this document to see if it is allowed.
2. If it creates a **circular dependency**, extract the shared type to `Core` or `Contracts`.
3. Update the `.csproj` `<ProjectReference>` entries.
4. Update this document.
5. Verify with `dotnet build -c Release`.
6. The `pr-checks.yml` CI workflow will catch any violations on pull request.

## BannedReferences.txt

The `MarketDataCollector.Domain` project includes a `BannedReferences.txt` file that explicitly lists assemblies that Domain must never reference. This provides an additional safety net beyond project references.

## UI Layer Dependency Rules

The four UI-facing projects follow the same dependency direction rules but are isolated from one another:

* **`MarketDataCollector.Ui.Shared`** – web endpoint mapping and host wiring; may reference `Application` and `Contracts`. Must not reference `Ui.Services` or `Wpf`.
* **`MarketDataCollector.Ui.Services`** – cross-feature shared UI services (API client, fixture data, validation); may reference `Contracts` and lightweight platform-neutral libs. Must not reference WPF or `Ui.Shared`.
* **`MarketDataCollector.Ui`** – intentionally thin web host; delegates to `Ui.Shared`. No application logic lives here.
* **`MarketDataCollector.Wpf`** – Windows desktop host with XAML views and WPF services; references `Ui.Services` and `Contracts`. Must not reference `Ui.Shared` or `Ui`.

See [Desktop & UI Layer Architecture](desktop-layers.md) for a detailed diagram and communication flow.

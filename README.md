## What This Project Does

Meridian is a self-hosted, multi-pillar algorithmic trading platform. It provides everything needed to collect market data at scale, develop and validate trading strategies through backtesting, execute strategies with zero financial risk using paper trading, and manage the complete strategy lifecycle from research to production deployment. All pillars—data collection, backtesting, execution, and strategy management—are built on a unified, event-driven architecture and fully integrated.

### Platform Pillars

| Pillar | Projects | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **📡 Data Collection** | `Meridian.*` core projects | ✅ Production-ready — 90+ streaming and 10+ backfill providers |
| **🔬 Backtesting** | `Meridian.Backtesting`, `.Backtesting.Sdk` | ✅ Production-ready — tick-level engine with fill models and metrics |
| **⚡ Execution** | `Meridian.Execution`, `.Execution.Sdk` | ✅ Paper trading gateway active — ready for live integration |
| **🗂️ Strategies** | `Meridian.Strategies` | ✅ Lifecycle management — register, backtest, paper-trade, promote to live |

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | What It Does For You |
|------------|---------------------|
| **📡 Real-Time Streaming** | Capture live trades, quotes, and order book depth as they happen from Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, NYSE, Polygon, or StockSharp |
| **📥 Historical Backfill** | Download years of historical price data from 10+ providers (Yahoo Finance, Tiingo, Polygon, Alpaca, and more) with automatic failover |
| **💾 Local Data Storage** | Own your data — everything is stored in structured JSONL or Parquet files on your machine, not locked in a vendor's cloud |
| **🔍 Data Quality Monitoring** | Automatic validation catches missing data, sequence gaps, and anomalies before they corrupt your analysis |
| **📦 Data Packaging** | Export and package your data for sharing, backup, or use in other tools |
| **📊 Live Dashboards** | Monitor collection status, throughput, and data quality through a web dashboard or Windows desktop app |
| **🔬 Backtesting Engine** | Replay tick-level historical data through strategy plugins; compute Sharpe, drawdown, XIRR, and full fill tape |
| **📒 Portfolio Ledger** | Record cash, positions, commissions, financing, and realized P&L through double-entry accounting for audit and analysis |
| **⚡ Paper Trading** | Run strategies against a live feed with zero financial risk using `PaperTradingGateway` (ADR-015); execution UX is being migrated into a dedicated trading cockpit |
| **🗂️ Strategy Lifecycle** | Register, start, pause, stop, and archive strategy runs with full audit trail and promotion workflow |

### Who Is This For?

- **Quantitative researchers** who need tick-level market microstructure data for analysis
- **Algorithmic traders** building and validating strategies before committing real capital
- **Data engineers** who want to build a reliable market data pipeline
- **Hobbyist traders** who want to collect, backtest, and paper-trade their own strategies
- **Students and academics** studying market microstructure, price formation, or trading systems

### The Problem It Solves

Commercial market data is expensive, vendor APIs change without notice, and cloud-only
solutions mean you never truly own your data or your strategy infrastructure. Meridian gives you:

1. **Data independence** — Switch providers without losing your archive or rewriting code
2. **Cost control** — Use free-tier APIs strategically, pay only for premium data you actually need
3. **Reliability** — Automatic reconnection, failover between providers, and data integrity checks
4. **Flexibility** — Collect exactly the symbols and data types you need, store them how you want
5. **Paper-first safety** — Validate every strategy in simulation before any real capital is committed

---

## Installation

### Golden Path (Recommended)

Use the installation orchestrator script for all setups. It keeps Docker and native installs consistent across platforms.

```bash
# Interactive installer (Docker or Native)
./build/scripts/install/install.sh

# Or choose a mode explicitly
./build/scripts/install/install.sh --docker
./build/scripts/install/install.sh --native
```

Access the dashboard at **http://localhost:8080**

### Windows Installation

The PowerShell installer mirrors the same workflow on Windows.

```powershell
# Interactive installation
.\build\scripts\install\install.ps1

# Or specify mode directly
.\build\scripts\install\install.ps1 -Mode Docker
.\build\scripts\install\install.ps1 -Mode Native
```

### Optional Make Wrappers

Make targets remain available as thin wrappers around the installer and runtime commands.

```bash
make help
make docker
make run-ui
make test
make doctor
```

Desktop-focused helpers:

```bash
make desktop-dev-bootstrap   # Validate desktop development environment (PowerShell)
make build-wpf               # Build WPF desktop app (Windows only)
make test-desktop-services   # Run desktop-focused tests (includes WPF service tests on Windows)
```

### Windows Desktop App Install

**WPF Desktop App (Recommended)** - Modern WPF application with maximum Windows stability
- Works on Windows 7+
- Simple .exe deployment
- Direct assembly references (no WinRT limitations)
- See [WPF README](src/Meridian.Wpf/README.md) for details

**Installation:**
```bash
# Build from source
dotnet build src/Meridian.Wpf/Meridian.Wpf.csproj -c Release

# Run
dotnet run --project src/Meridian.Wpf/Meridian.Wpf.csproj
```

---

## Desktop Development

### Setting Up Desktop Development Environment

For contributors working on the WPF desktop application, use the desktop development bootstrap script to validate your environment:

```bash
make desktop-dev-bootstrap
```

This script validates:
- ✅ .NET 9 SDK installation
- ✅ Windows SDK presence (Windows only)
- ✅ Visual Studio Build Tools
- ✅ XAML tooling support
- ✅ Desktop project restore and smoke build

The script provides actionable fix messages for any missing components.

### Desktop Testing

The repository includes comprehensive tests for desktop services:

```bash
# Run all desktop-focused tests (platform-aware)
make test-desktop-services

# On Windows, this runs:
# - WPF-specific tests (binding/navigation/desktop host wiring)
# - Shared desktop UI service tests
#
# On non-Windows platforms, use Meridian.Tests for startup/composition/contracts/endpoint-shape coverage
```

**Test Projects:**
- `tests/Meridian.Tests` - cross-platform startup, composition, contract, endpoint-shape, and core/backend tests
- `tests/Meridian.Wpf.Tests` - Windows-only WPF-specific binding, navigation, and desktop host wiring
  - NavigationServiceTests (14 tests)
  - ConfigServiceTests (13 tests)
  - StatusServiceTests (13 tests)
  - ConnectionServiceTests (18 tests)
- `tests/Meridian.Ui.Tests` - shared desktop UI service logic under the existing Windows target
  - ApiClientServiceTests, BackfillServiceTests, FixtureDataServiceTests
  - FormValidationServiceTests, SystemHealthServiceTests, WatchlistServiceTests
  - BoundedObservableCollectionTests, CircularBufferTests

### Desktop Build Commands

```bash
# Build WPF application (Windows only)
make build-wpf
```

---

**Troubleshooting install**
- **Missing signing certificate**: Install the signing cert or use a release-signed package; unsigned MSIX packages cannot be installed.
- **Blocked package**: If Windows SmartScreen blocks the installer, choose **More info → Run anyway**, or unblock the downloaded file in **Properties**.

---

## Technical Overview

Meridian is built on **.NET 9.0** using **C# 13** and **F# 8.0** across **704 source files** (692 C# + 12 F# in `src/`), with **273 test files** (~4,100 test methods). It uses a modular, event-driven architecture with bounded channels (System.Threading.Channels) for high-throughput data processing. The unified architecture spans all four pillars: data collection, backtesting, execution, and strategy management. The system supports deployment as a single self-contained executable, a Docker container, or a systemd service.

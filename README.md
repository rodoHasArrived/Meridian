## What This Project Does

Market Data Collector is a complete solution for **building your own market data archive**. It connects to financial data providers, captures market data in real-time, and stores everything locally so you have full ownership and offline access to your data.

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | What It Does For You |
|------------|---------------------|
| **📡 Real-Time Streaming** | Capture live trades, quotes, and order book depth as they happen from Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, NYSE, Polygon, or StockSharp |
| **📥 Historical Backfill** | Download years of historical price data from 10+ providers (Yahoo Finance, Tiingo, Polygon, Alpaca, and more) with automatic failover |
| **💾 Local Data Storage** | Own your data—everything is stored in structured JSONL or Parquet files on your machine, not locked in a vendor's cloud |
| **🔍 Data Quality Monitoring** | Automatic validation catches missing data, sequence gaps, and anomalies before they corrupt your analysis |
| **📦 Data Packaging** | Export and package your data for sharing, backup, or use in other tools |
| **📊 Live Dashboards** | Monitor collection status, throughput, and data quality through a web dashboard or Windows desktop app |
| **🔬 Backtesting Integration** | Feed your collected data directly into QuantConnect Lean for algorithmic strategy development |

### Who Is This For?

- **Quantitative researchers** who need tick-level market microstructure data for analysis
- **Algorithmic traders** building strategies that require historical and real-time market data
- **Data engineers** who want to build a reliable market data pipeline
- **Hobbyist traders** who want to collect and own their own market data archive
- **Students and academics** studying market microstructure, price formation, or trading systems

### The Problem It Solves

Commercial market data is expensive, vendor APIs change without notice, and cloud-only solutions mean you never truly own your data. Market Data Collector gives you:

1. **Data independence** — Switch providers without losing your archive or rewriting code
2. **Cost control** — Use free-tier APIs strategically, pay only for premium data you actually need
3. **Reliability** — Automatic reconnection, failover between providers, and data integrity checks
4. **Flexibility** — Collect exactly the symbols and data types you need, store them how you want

## Installation

### Golden Path (Recommended)

Use the installation orchestrator script for all setups. It keeps Docker and native installs consistent across platforms.

```bash
# Interactive installer (Docker or Native)
./scripts/install/install.sh

# Or choose a mode explicitly
./scripts/install/install.sh --docker
./scripts/install/install.sh --native
```

Access the dashboard at **http://localhost:8080**

### Windows Installation

The PowerShell installer mirrors the same workflow on Windows.

```powershell
# Interactive installation
.\scripts\install\install.ps1

# Or specify mode directly
.\scripts\install\install.ps1 -Mode Docker
.\scripts\install\install.ps1 -Mode Native
```

### Optional Make Wrappers

Make targets remain available as thin wrappers around the installer and runtime commands.

```bash
make help
make docker
make run-ui
make test
make doctor
```

Desktop-focused helpers:

```bash
make desktop-dev-bootstrap   # Validate desktop development environment (PowerShell)
make build-wpf               # Build WPF desktop app (Windows only)
make test-desktop-services   # Run desktop-focused tests (includes WPF service tests on Windows)
```

### Windows Desktop App Install

**WPF Desktop App (Recommended)** - Modern WPF application with maximum Windows stability
- Works on Windows 7+
- Simple .exe deployment
- Direct assembly references (no WinRT limitations)
- See [WPF README](src/MarketDataCollector.Wpf/README.md) for details

**Installation:**
```bash
# Build from source
dotnet build src/MarketDataCollector.Wpf/MarketDataCollector.Wpf.csproj -c Release

# Run
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector.Wpf/MarketDataCollector.Wpf.csproj
```

---

## Desktop Development

### Setting Up Desktop Development Environment

For contributors working on the WPF desktop application, use the desktop development bootstrap script to validate your environment:

```bash
make desktop-dev-bootstrap
```

This script validates:
- ✅ .NET 9 SDK installation
- ✅ Windows SDK presence (Windows only)
- ✅ Visual Studio Build Tools
- ✅ XAML tooling support
- ✅ Desktop project restore and smoke build

The script provides actionable fix messages for any missing components.

### Desktop Testing

The repository includes comprehensive tests for desktop services:

```bash
# Run all desktop-focused tests (platform-aware)
make test-desktop-services

# On Windows, this runs:
# - WPF service tests (NavigationService, ConfigService, StatusService, ConnectionService)
# - Desktop UI service tests (ApiClientService, BackfillService, FixtureDataService, etc.)
# - Integration tests for desktop-specific functionality

# On non-Windows platforms, runs available integration tests only
```

**Test Projects:**
- `tests/MarketDataCollector.Wpf.Tests` - 58 tests for WPF singleton services
  - NavigationServiceTests (14 tests)
  - ConfigServiceTests (13 tests)
  - StatusServiceTests (13 tests)
  - ConnectionServiceTests (18 tests)
- `tests/MarketDataCollector.Ui.Tests` - 71 tests for desktop UI services
  - ApiClientServiceTests, BackfillServiceTests, FixtureDataServiceTests
  - FormValidationServiceTests, SystemHealthServiceTests, WatchlistServiceTests
  - BoundedObservableCollectionTests, CircularBufferTests

### Desktop Build Commands

```bash
# Build WPF application (Windows only)
make build-wpf
```

---

**Troubleshooting install**
- **Missing signing certificate**: Install the signing cert or use a release-signed package; unsigned MSIX packages cannot be installed.
- **Blocked package**: If Windows SmartScreen blocks the installer, choose **More info → Run anyway**, or unblock the downloaded file in **Properties**.

## Technical Overview

Market Data Collector is built on **.NET 9.0** using **C# 13** and **F# 8.0** across 635 source files. It uses a modular, event-driven architecture with bounded channels for high-throughput data processing. The system supports deployment as a single self-contained executable, a Docker container, or a systemd service.

## Key Features

### Data Collection
- **Multi-provider ingest**: Interactive Brokers (L2 depth, tick-by-tick), Alpaca (WebSocket streaming), NYSE (direct feed), Polygon (aggregates), StockSharp (multi-exchange)
- **Historical backfill**: 10+ providers (Yahoo Finance, Stooq, Tiingo, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, Nasdaq Data Link, Polygon, IB) with automatic failover
- **Provider-agnostic architecture**: Swap feeds without code changes and preserve stream IDs for reconciliation
- **Microstructure detail**: Tick-by-tick trades, Level 2 order book, BBO quotes, and order-flow statistics

### Performance and Reliability
- **High-performance pipeline**: Bounded channel architecture (default 50,000 events) with configurable backpressure
- **Integrity validation**: Sequence checks and order book integrity enforcement with dedicated event emission
- **Hot configuration reload**: Apply subscription changes without restarting the collector
- **Graceful shutdown**: Flushes all events and metrics before exit

### Storage and Data Management
- **Flexible JSONL storage**: Default BySymbol naming convention `{root}/{symbol}/{type}/{date}.jsonl` for optimal organization (also supports ByDate, ByType, Flat) with optional gzip compression
- **Partitioning and retention**: Daily/hourly/monthly/none plus retention by age or total capacity
- **Data replay**: Stream historical JSONL files for backtesting and research

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Web dashboard**: Modern HTML dashboard for live monitoring, integrity event tracking, and backfill controls
- **Native Windows app**: WPF desktop application for Windows-only configuration and monitoring
- **Metrics and status**: Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`, JSON status at `/status`, HTML dashboard at `/`
- **Logging**: Structured logging via Serilog with ready-to-use sinks

### Security
- **Secure credential management**: Windows CredentialPicker integration for API keys and secrets
- **Credential protection**: `.gitignore` excludes sensitive configuration files from version control
- **Environment variable support**: API credentials via environment variables for production deployments

### Architecture
- **Monolithic core**: Simple, maintainable architecture with optional UI components
- **Provider abstraction**: Clean interfaces for adding new data providers
- **ADR compliance**: Architecture Decision Records for consistent design patterns

## Quick Start

### New User? Use the Configuration Wizard

dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj -- --auto-config

# Check what providers are available
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj -- --detect-providers

# Validate your API credentials
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj -- --validate-credentials
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rodoHasArrived/Market-Data-Collector.git
cd Market-Data-Collector

# Copy the sample settings and edit as needed
cp config/appsettings.sample.json config/appsettings.json

# Option 1: Launch the web dashboard (serves HTML + Prometheus + JSON status)
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj -- --ui --watch-config --http-port 8080

# Run smoke test (no provider connectivity required)
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj

# Run self-tests
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj -- --selftest

# Historical backfill with overrides
dotnet run --project src/MarketDataCollector/MarketDataCollector.csproj -- \
  --backfill --backfill-provider stooq --backfill-symbols SPY,AAPL \
  --backfill-from 2024-01-01 --backfill-to 2024-01-05
```

Access the monitoring dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`, JSON status at `http://localhost:8080/status`, and Prometheus metrics at `http://localhost:8080/metrics`.

- **Data Provider**: Custom `IDataProvider` implementation for JSONL files
- **Sample Algorithms**: Ready-to-use examples for microstructure-aware trading

See [`src/MarketDataCollector/Integrations/Lean/README.md`](src/MarketDataCollector/Integrations/Lean/README.md) for integration details and examples.

## Output Data

Market data is stored as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) files with:
- Configurable naming conventions (by symbol, date, or type)
- Optional gzip compression
- Automatic retention management
- Data integrity events alongside market data

## Monitoring and Backfill Control

The built-in HTTP server provides:
- **Prometheus metrics** at `/metrics`
- **JSON status** at `/status`
- **Live HTML dashboard** at `/`
- **Health checks** at `/health`, `/ready`, `/live` (Kubernetes-compatible)
- **Backfill status and controls** at `/api/backfill/*`

Monitor event throughput, drop rates, integrity events, and pipeline statistics in real-time. Initiate or review historical backfill jobs directly from the dashboard without restarting the collector.

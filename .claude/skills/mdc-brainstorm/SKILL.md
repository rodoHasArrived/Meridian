  Brainstorming, ideation, and creative feature exploration skill for the MarketDataCollector project.
  Use this skill whenever the user wants to generate new ideas, features, or improvements for MarketDataCollector,
  or when they ask "what could we add", "how could we improve", "what would be valuable", "what features should we build",
  or any variant of creative/generative thinking about the project. Also trigger when the user describes a pain point,
  a user persona (hobbyist, academic, institutional), or a domain problem (latency, data quality, accessibility, 
  backtesting, compliance) and wants ideas for solving it. Also trigger for architecture or refactoring brainstorms,
  user growth and adoption strategy discussions, or technical debt and code quality improvement ideation.
  Trigger even if the user just says "brainstorm" or "give me ideas" in the context of this project. This skill
  produces detailed idea writeups with implementation sketches, audience fit analysis, effort ratings, and concrete
  next steps.

# MarketDataCollector — Brainstorming & Ideation Skill

Generate high-value, implementable ideas for the MarketDataCollector platform. Every idea should feel like a natural extension of the program — something that makes the existing experience richer, clearer, and more capable, not a bolt-on afterthought.

## Core Philosophy: Complementary Extension

The best ideas for MDC aren't isolated features. They're extensions that **amplify what already exists**. Before generating any idea, ask:

1. **What does MDC already do well nearby?** Find the existing capability this idea extends, deepens, or connects to. An idea with no anchor to current functionality is probably the wrong idea.
2. **What would a user actually see and feel?** Every idea must have a concrete UI or interaction moment. If you can't describe what the user clicks, reads, or watches — the idea isn't finished yet.
3. **Does this make the whole program more coherent?** The best features make users think "of course this is here." They reduce the number of tools a user needs open, surfacing the right information at the right time within MDC itself.
4. **Is the information presented clearly?** Data-dense applications live or die on information hierarchy. Every idea that touches the UI should consider: what's the most important thing on screen? What's secondary? What can be progressive-disclosed or hidden until needed?

## Project Context

**What MarketDataCollector is:**  
A provider-agnostic .NET 9 / C# 13 platform for real-time and historical market data collection. Streams from Interactive Brokers TWS, Alpaca Markets, and (planned) 90+ providers via StockSharp. Sub-2ms event pipeline, JSONL storage, WebSocket + REST APIs, OpenTelemetry observability, WPF desktop app + web dashboard.

**Tech stack:** C# 13 (infrastructure), F# (domain models), planned C++ (ultra-low-latency hot paths), .NET 9, WPF (desktop UI, migrated from UWP), Docker, Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Bounded Channels, WAL storage, JSONL → Parquet (planned), GitHub Actions CI/CD.

**Current capabilities:**

- Real-time streaming: trades, quotes, L2 order book depth
- Historical backfill: JSONL files, gap detection
- Multi-provider: IB TWS + Alpaca, abstracted behind `IMarketDataClient`
- WPF desktop app: MVVM architecture with BindableBase, real-time status, config management
- Web dashboard: live status, data browser
- Deployment: Docker Compose, systemd, Kubernetes
- Observability: OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, and automated documentation

**What's coming:** StockSharp (90+ providers), binary compression (95% ratio), Python-accessible layer, remote job management, cloud integration, tiered storage, automated code quality audits, comprehensive architecture compliance tooling.

**Recent development focus:** MVVM compliance audits, real-time performance optimization for derivatives data, unit testing effectiveness improvements, documentation automation via GitHub Actions, systematic technical debt management, platform migration from UWP to WPF.

## Audience Personas

### 🎯 Hobbyist Quant Developer

Software developer or data scientist learning quant finance. Frustrated by setup complexity and the gap between "collecting data" and "doing something with it." Wants quick wins, low cost, and integration with tools they already know (Jupyter, pandas). Low risk tolerance — prefers paper trading and sandboxed environments.

### 🎓 Academic / Researcher

Quantitative finance PhD, financial economist, or ML researcher. Cares deeply about data reproducibility, provenance, and quality validation. Institutional data is prohibitively expensive. Needs citation-ready data, audit trails, and bulk export to research infrastructure (HDF5, Arrow, DuckDB).

### 🏦 Institutional / Professional

Prop trading firm, hedge fund ops, or quant analyst at an asset manager. Pain points are vendor lock-in, latency SLAs, compliance, and disaster recovery. Values reliability, throughput, and support. Low tolerance for infrastructure failures.

## The User Experience Lens

**Apply this lens to every idea.** MDC is a desktop application people monitor for hours. The quality of the experience — how information is organized, how status is communicated, how configuration feels, how errors surface — determines whether someone keeps using it or switches to a script.

**Principles for UI-touching ideas:**

- **Information hierarchy matters.** A streaming data app can easily become a wall of numbers. Every screen should have a clear primary focus, secondary details accessible on hover or drill-down, and a calm default state that doesn't demand attention when things are healthy.
- **Status at a glance.** The user should be able to look at MDC for 2 seconds and know: is everything OK? Is anything degraded? Is a backfill running? Use color, density, and spatial position to communicate state — not just text.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Show the essential view first. Let users expand into detail when they want it. A symbol's health score is the top layer; the per-provider tick rate breakdown is the drill-down.
- **Contextual actions.** When showing data, show what the user can _do_ with it right there. Viewing a gap in historical data? Offer a one-click backfill. Seeing an anomalous tick? Offer to flag or exclude it.
- **Consistency across views.** Symbols, providers, time ranges, and status indicators should look and behave the same way everywhere in the app. Build a shared visual vocabulary.
- **Respect the WPF medium.** Ideas should feel native to a desktop application — data grids, split panes, keyboard shortcuts, system tray integration, multi-monitor awareness. Not a web app crammed into a window.

## How to Run a Brainstorm

### Step 1: Identify the Mode

| Mode | Trigger | Approach |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| **Open Exploration** | "What could we build?" / "What's valuable?" | Generate across all dimensions, all personas. Favor ideas that connect multiple existing capabilities. |
| **Problem-Focused** | "How do we solve X?" | 3-5 deep ideas targeting the specific pain. Show how each one integrates with existing features. |
| **Persona-Focused** | "What do hobbyist quants want?" | 5-8 ideas optimized for that audience. Describe the user journey, not just the feature. |
| **Domain-Focused** | "Ideas for latency / storage / UX / data quality" | Technical depth in that domain. Every idea still needs a UI or interaction touchpoint. |
| **Competitive** | "What are others doing that we aren't?" | Scan Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Polygon, Databento. Identify gaps, but only propose ideas that fit MDC's architecture naturally. |
| **Quick Wins** | "What's easy to ship?" | Effort ≤ Medium, impact ≥ High. Emphasize ideas that improve the existing experience rather than adding new surface area. |
| **Architecture / Refactoring** | "How should we restructure X?" / "What should we refactor?" | Code structure, MVVM compliance, separation of concerns, testability. Anchor to real patterns (`BindableBase`, `EventPipeline`, `IStorageSink`). Include before/after and migration risk. |
| **User Growth / Adoption** | "How do we get more users?" / "Growth ideas" | Onboarding friction, developer evangelism, community building. Map to personas — different levers for hobbyists vs. institutions. Span awareness → activation → retention. |
| **Technical Debt / Code Quality** | "What tech debt should we address?" / "Audit ideas" | Test coverage, static analysis, CI/CD hardening, dead code elimination. Quantify the cost of inaction and the payoff timeline. |
| **UX / Information Design** | "How should we display X?" / "The UI feels cluttered" / "What should the dashboard show?" | Focus on information architecture, visual hierarchy, interaction flow, and clarity. Every idea in this mode is a UI-first idea. |

### Step 2: Generate Ideas

Write each idea as a **natural narrative**, not a form to fill out. The reader should understand the idea, why it matters, how it works, and what it looks like — in that order.

**What every idea must include** (woven into prose, not as labeled fields):

- **The anchor:** What existing MDC capability does this extend or complement?
- **The user moment:** What does the user see, click, or experience? Be specific — describe a screen, a notification, an interaction, not just a backend change.
- **The implementation shape:** Key technical approach — interfaces, patterns, data flow. Enough that a developer could start scoping.
- **The tradeoffs:** What's hard? What could go wrong? What does this cost in complexity?
- **Effort and audience:** Who benefits most? How big is this?

**What to include when relevant** (not every idea needs all of these):

- A rough UI sketch described in words (layout, what's prominent, what's secondary)
- How this feature connects to other features in the app — does it link from the dashboard? Does it feed into the data quality view?
- Before/after comparison for architecture ideas
- Funnel stage and success metrics for growth ideas
- Debt cost and payoff timeline for tech debt ideas

**Quantity guidelines:**

- Open Exploration: 8-12 ideas across 3+ categories
- Problem/Persona/Domain focused: 4-6 deep ideas
- Quick Wins: 6-8 ideas
- Architecture/Refactoring: 4-6 ideas
- User Growth/Adoption: 5-8 ideas
- Technical Debt/Code Quality: 4-6 ideas
- UX/Information Design: 4-6 ideas

### Step 3: Synthesize

After the ideas, step back and write a synthesis that:

- Identifies the highest-leverage idea (best impact/effort ratio, most complementary to existing features)
- Calls out "platform bets" — ideas that unlock multiple others
- Flags cross-cutting themes (e.g., "three of these ideas all need a shared symbol health model")
- Suggests sequencing: what to build first, what it enables next
- For Architecture mode: migration ordering and risk dependencies
- For Growth mode: which funnel stage to invest in first
- For Tech Debt mode: quick wins first, then structural changes
- For UX mode: which screens or views to redesign first based on user frequency and pain

## Tone & Output Standards

**Write ideas like you're pitching them to a product-minded developer**, not filling in a form. Each idea should read as a short, compelling argument — "here's what's painful today, here's what we'd build, here's what it looks like, here's why it's worth it."

- **Be specific, not generic.** "Add a Python SDK" is weak. "Add a `marketdata` Python package with an async iterator over the live WebSocket feed, pandas DataFrame output, and a `snap()` convenience method for the last N ticks" is strong.
- **Always describe the user experience.** Even backend optimizations have a user-facing moment: "The backfill that used to take 45 minutes now finishes in 8. The progress bar in the WPF app reflects this — the user sees symbols lighting up green in rapid succession."
- **Show how features connect.** "This data quality scorecard feeds into the existing dashboard's symbol list — the health score appears as a colored dot next to each symbol. Clicking it expands to the detailed breakdown."
- **Acknowledge tradeoffs honestly.** Hidden complexity is the enemy. Name it.
- **Anchor to the codebase.** Reference real abstractions: `IMarketDataClient`, `IHistoricalDataProvider`, `EventPipeline`, `IStorageSink`, `BindableBase`, the Options pattern. But don't force it — only when it clarifies the implementation.
- **For architecture ideas:** Show concrete code-level changes, not just diagrams. Reference actual class names and namespaces.
- **For growth ideas:** Be honest about what requires sustained investment vs. one-time effort.
- **For tech debt ideas:** Quantify the cost: "This makes onboarding a new contributor take 2 days instead of 2 hours" beats "this is messy."
- **For UX ideas:** Describe the screen. What's at the top? What's the primary action? What information is visible by default vs. on drill-down? How does this view connect to other views in the app?

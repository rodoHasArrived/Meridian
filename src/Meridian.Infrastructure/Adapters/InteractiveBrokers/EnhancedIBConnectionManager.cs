/// IB connection manager that owns the socket/EReader loop and forwards raw callbacks into <see cref="IBCallbackRouter"/>.
///
/// This file is buildable out-of-the-box:
/// - When compiled WITHOUT the official IB API reference, it exposes a small stub implementation.
/// - When compiled WITH the IB API (define the compilation constant IBAPI and reference IBApi),
///   it provides a full EWrapper implementation with depth routing.
///
/// Connection Resilience (IBAPI build):
/// - Uses ExponentialBackoffRetry for connection retry with configurable delays (1s initial, 2min max)
/// - Implements HeartbeatMonitor for connection health detection
/// - Automatic reconnection on connection loss with jitter to prevent thundering herd
/// - Unlimited retry attempts by default (configurable via maxRetries parameter)
/// - See EnhancedIBConnectionManager.IBApi.cs and Infrastructure/Performance/ConnectionWarmUp.cs for implementation
/// </summary>
